  <p>
   This is the hypertext edition of the Lisp Machine Manual.  It
   describes the Lisp Machine system software, which has been
   developed between 1978 and 1984 at the MIT.
  </p>
  <p>
   This version of the manual is the result of automatically
   converting the source files of the printed 6th edition of the
   original manual, edited by Richard Stallman. The intention of the
   conversion is to bring the manual into a more modern format that
   could be read and edited using contemporary tools.  The goal is to
   make the Lisp Machine documentation widely available and editable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Originally, the manual was authored as text files with markup for
   the ``Bolio'' text processor, which ran on the PDP-10 systems and
   Lisp machines at the MIT in the 1980ies.  Neither the source nor
   the documentation for Bolio were available at the time the
   conversion has been done.  As such the meaning of the markup had to
   be deduced from the context andthere may be errors of deficiencies
   in the hypertext edition that are a result of the conversion
   process.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hypertext edition of the manual consists of files in an XML
   format that resembles the original document stucture.  It does not
   use a well-known XML schema or DTD.  XSL templates are provided to
   convert the XML format to HTML for online browsing.  Conversion to
   other documentation formats like DocBook or Texinfo are possible,
   but the intention is to support these format in an output-only
   matter.
